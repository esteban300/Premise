Premise
=======

Another CSS framework

Yes, Premise is just another CSS framework. The key thing about premise is that it is meant to avoid repetitive and redundant css by offering you a variety of classes that do all the most common things for you. To keep the framework lightweight we only focus on optimizing code for the most common structure and design elements people want and need. So with Premise you get two things: 1) Build layouts in minutes and easily create common elemnets like mobile navs, or form elemnets. 2) Get non-repetitive, non-redundant lightweight CSS and JS with most common UI/UX lements design and functionality. Integrated with Font Awesome.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<h3>Basic elements</h3>
These basic classes give you the most common attributes you probably write in CSS. Just by adding these classes to your elements you cut so much redundant CSS.
<pre>
	<!-- Basic classes -->
	<!-- by simply adding these basic classes to any 
	element in your HTML you can save yourself a lot
	of time writing CSS -->
	<!-- Give an element a display:block -->
	<div class="block">
		<span>
			Hello!
		</span>
	</div>
</pre>
